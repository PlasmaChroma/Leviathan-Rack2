## "Record Scratch" Module

- Stereo Inputs
- Allows physical interaction with the virtual 'record' to perform with it
- Has CV inputs that also interact with it
- Interactive and CV allow back and forward (up to recorded limit)
- Buffer continuously fills with up to 10+? second  of buffered audio
- Maybe try to tune specifically to how a record would work
- (Ring) Buffering continues while user is scratched backwards.
- We can just be playing back buffer indefinately if user never moves back forward
  - Meaning maybe we would expire the buffer when it's 10+ second behind (again)
